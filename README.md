## Hi there, I'm Gabe Lao ðŸ‘‹
- Student at Virginia Tech studying Cybersecurity Management and Analytics


# ðŸ”­ These are the projects that I'm currently working on:
  - Making an designer form for customer invoice management on Visual Basics
    - User Stories:
      - I want to enter a customer's name (or part of it) into a search box, so that I can quickly retrieve and view the customer's details and associated invoices.
      - I want to see a list of invoices related to that customer, so I can have a consolidated view of all transactions associated with the selected customer.
      - I want to see a detailed breakdown of that invoice, including products, quantities, and the total cost, to better understand the specifics of each transaction.

# ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning more about Information and Network Security
  - In preparation for my CompTIA certification


# Check my other repositories to see what I have been working on/completed.
